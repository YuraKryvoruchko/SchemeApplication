# About

- **Project name:** Scheme Application

---

It's an application for **creating and simulating** electronic logic schemes. You can create and connect logical blocks(such as AND, OR and NOT), as well as splitters and the scheme's inputs and outputs. You can then simulate your scheme by entering data and viewing the output data in a table.

This is a program developed as part of a coursework for the second semester of the second year.
